# Counterfactual-Regret-Minimization
Using the CFRM algorithm to make a game theory optimal bot for the game Khun Poker. You can play against the bot in real time. CFRM algorithm will be written in python and the game code will be written in GoLang. I treat this project as 1. to learn about the CFRM algorithm in imperfect information games and 2. to learn GoLang
